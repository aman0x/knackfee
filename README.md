# Hello World example

This example shows the most basic idea behind Next. We have 2 pages: `pages/index.tsx` and `pages/about.tsx`. The former responds to `/` requests and the latter to `/about`. Using `next/link` you can add hyperlinks between them with universal routing capabilities. The `day` directory shows that you can have subdirectories.
